According to the World Health Organisation, health care embraces all the goods and \\nservices designed to promote health, including “preventive, curative and palliative interventions, \\nwhether directed to individuals or to populations”. The organised provision of such services may \\nconstitute a health care system.  \\nHealth is defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well being and just not the \\nnon existence of disease or ailment. Health is a primary human right and has been accorded due \\nimportance by the Constitution through Article 21.Though Article 21 stresses upon state governments \\nto safeguard the health and nutritional well being of the people, the central governme nt also plays an \\nactive role in the sector.

Since ancient times \\ntraditional practitioners of health care have cont ributed to the medicinal needs of society. Acute \\nknowledge in the medicinal properties of plants and herbs were passed on from one generation to \\nanother to be used for treatment. The colonial rule and the dominance of the British changed the \\nscenario. Hospitals managed by Christian missionaries took centre stage. Even the intellectual elite in \\nIndia with their pro west bias favored Western practices. \\nAfter Independence \\nPrior to independence the healthcare in India was in shambles with large number of deaths  and \\nspread of infectious diseases. After independence the Government of India laid stress on Primary \\nHealth Care and India has put in sustained efforts to better the health care system across the country. \\nThe government initiative was not enough to meet t he demands from a growing population be it in \\nprimary, secondary or tertiary health care. Alternate sources of finance were critical for the \\nsustainability of the health sector. \\nEntry of Private Sector \\nTill about 20 years back, the private sectors venture in the health care sector consisted of only \\nsolo practitioners, small hospitals and nursing homes. The quality of service provided was excellent \\nespecially in the hospitals run by charitable trusts and religious foundations. In 1980's realizing that the \\ngovernment on its own would not be able to provide health care, the government allowed the entry of \\nprivate sector to reduce the gap between supply and demand for healthcare. The private hospitals are \\nmanaged by corporate, non- profit or charitable organizations. The establishment of private sector has \\nresulted in the emergence of opportunities in terms of medical equipment, information technology in \\nhealth services, BPO, Telemedicine and medical tourism. \\nLarge companies and affluent individuals have started f ive star hospitals which dominate the \\nspace for high end market. The private sector has made tremendous progress, but on the flip side it is \\nalso responsible for increasing inequality in healthcare sector. The private should be more socially \\nrelevant and efforts must be made to make private sector accessible to the weaker section of society. \\nHealth care system in India \\nTraditional Healthcare Systems in India \", metadata={'source': 'data/HealthCareSectorinindia-AnOverview.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' In India, in addition to existence of modern medicine, indigenous or traditional medical \\npractitioners continue to practice throughout the country. Popular indigenous healthcare traditions \\ninclude Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, and Yoga.  \\nThe Ayurveda (meaning science of life) system deals with causes, symptoms, diagnoses, and \\ntreatment based on all aspects of well -being (mental, physical, and spiritual). These professionals, \\ntraditionally, have been inheriting the skills from their ancestors. However, with the advent of \\neducation, a variety of institutions offer training in indigenous medical practice. \\nThe Siddha system defines disease as the condition in which the normal equilibrium of the five \\nelements in human beings is lost resulting in different forms of discomfort. The diagnostic methods in \\nSiddha medical system are based more on  the clinical acumen of the physician after observation of the \\npatient, pulse and diagnosis and clinical history. \\nYoga is a science as well an art of healthy living physically, mentally, morally and spiritually. \\nYoga is believed to be founded by saints and sages of India several thousand years ago. Yoga has its \\norigin in the Vedas, and its philosophy is an art and science of living in tune with the universe. Yogis \\ngave rational interpretation of their experiences about Yoga and brought a practically sound a nd \\nscientifically prepared method within every one’s reach. \\nNaturopathy has several references in the Vedas and other ancient texts, which indicate that \\nthese methods were widely practised in ancient India. Naturopathy believes that all the diseases arise \\ndue to accumulation of morbid matter in the body and if scope is given for its removal, it provides cure \\nor relief. It also believes that the human body possesses inherent self -constructingand self -healing \\npowers. Naturopathy differs slightly with other sy stems of medicine, as it does not believe in the \\nspecific cause of disease and its specific treatment but takes into account the totality of factors \\nresponsible for diseases such as one’s un -natural habits in living, thinking, working, sleeping, or \\nrelaxation, and the environmental factors that disturbs the normal functioning of the body. \\nUnani system of medicine believes that the body is made up of four basic elements viz., earth, \\nair, water and fire, which have different temperaments i.e. cold, hot, wet a nd dry. After mixing and \\ninteraction of four elements a new compound having new temperament comes into existence i.e. hot -\\nwet, hot -dry, cold- wet and cold- dry. The body has simple and compound organs, which got their \\nnourishment through four humours, viz. blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile. Unani system of \\nmedicine believes in promotion of health, prevention of diseases and cure.  \\nIn addition to such healthcare systems, there are also faith / spiritual healers, who are largely \\npresent in rural parts of I ndia. Some spiritual leaders use one or more of the traditional therapies, viz, \\nAyurveda, Yoga or Naturopathy as one of the healing modes to cure their clients.

       " Document(page_content='Modern (Allopathic) Healthcare Systems in India \\n The modern (allopathic) health care system in India consists of a public sector, a private sector, \\nand an informal network of care providers. The size, scale, and spread of the country hampered \\ncomplete adherence to the number of well -intended guidelines and regulations. Although there are \\nnorms and g uidelines, compliance is minimal. In reality, the sector operates in a largely unregulated \\nenvironment, with minimal controls on what services can be provided, by whom, in what manner, and \\nat what cost. Thus, wide disparities occur in access, cost, levels,  and quality of health services provided \\nacross the country. \\n India’s health system can be categorized into three distinct phases: \\na) In the initial phase of 1947- 1983, health policy was assumed to be based on two broad principles: \\n(i) that none should be denied healthcare for want of ability to pay, and (ii) that it was the responsibility \\nof the state to provide healthcare to the people.This phase saw moderate achievements. \\nb) In the second phase of 1983 -2000, a National Health Policy was announced for the  first time in \\n1983, which articulated the need to encourage private initiative in healthcare service delivery and \\nencouraged the private sector to invest in healthcare infrastructure through subsidies. The policy also \\nenhanced the access to publicly funde d primary healthcare, facilitating expansion of health facilities in \\nrural areas through National Health Programmes (NHPs). \\nc) The third phase, post-2000, is witnessing a further shift and broadening of focus; the current phase \\naddresses key issues such as public-private partnership, liberalization of insurance sector, and the \\ngovernment as a financier. \\nRole of Public Sector in Health Care \\n The public healthcare system consists of facilities run by the central and state government.  \\nThese public facilities provide  free or subsidized rates to lower income families in rural and urban \\nareas.The Constitution of India divides health- related responsibilities between the central and the state \\ngovernments. While the national government maintains responsibility for m edical research  and \\ntechnical education, state governments shoulder the responsibility for infrastructure, employment, and \\nservice delivery. The concurrent list (in the 9th schedule to the Constitution of India) includes issues \\nthat concern more than one state, e.g., preventing extension of infectious or contagious diseases among \\nstates. While the states have significant autonomy in managing their health systems, the national \\ngovernment exercises significant fiscal control over the states’ health systems. \\n \\n ', metadata={'source': 'data/HealthCareSectorinindia-AnOverview.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Indian hotels are also entering the wellness services \\nmarket offering Spas and Ayurvedic massages, tying up with professional organizations in a range of \\nwellness fields. \\n Over the years the private health sector in India has grown remarkably. Given the \\noverwhelming presence of the private sector in health, various state governments in India have been \\nexploring the option of involving the private sector and creating partnerships with it in order to meet \\nthe growing health care needs of the population. \\n The private sector is not only India’s most unregulated sector but also its most potent untapped \\nsector. Although inequitable, expensive, over -indulgent in clinical procedures and without quality \\nstandards or public disclosure of practices, the private s ector is perceived to be easily accessible, better \\nmanaged and more efficient than its public counterpart. It is assumed that collaboration with the private \\nsector in the form of Public/Private Partnership would improve equity, efficiency, accountability, \\nquality and accessibility of the entire health system.

This percentage remains low and stagnant. While the \\npercentage of children between 12 -23 months of age that are fully immunized rose from 46% in 2004 \\nto 54% in 2008, these levels remain unacceptably low. Infant and maternal mortality rates are \\ndecreasing, but slowly. At the current rate of progress, India will not be able to achieve the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals for health. \\nChildhood nutrition: Despite the largest child -nutrition program in the world, rates of childhood \\nmalnutrition have remained unchanged for nearly two decades: 48% of children under the age of five \\nare stunted (low height for age), 43% are underweight (low weight for age), and 20% are wasted (low \\nweight for height). \\nNew diseases on the rise: At the same time, new health challenges are emerging.

Non-communicable diseases \\nand injuries already account for about 60% of India’s disease burden, led by cardiovascular disease, \\nmental health, injuries, cancer, and diabetes.  \\nUnfinished agenda of communicable diseases : Although the prevalence  of HIV has recently been \\nlowered to an estimated 0.41% of the adult population, or approximately 2.5 million individuals, this \\nstill poses a very significant burden and requires continued efforts to avoid a devastating, more \\ngeneralized epidemic. Tuberculosis, malaria, polio, and dengue fever  still remain serious threats in a \\nnumber of states. \\nFinancial burden:  At over 70% of all health spending, out -of-pocket expenditures are by far the main \\nfinancing mechanism for health care in India. This poses considerable financial burden on households.  \\nBased on the National Sample Survey (60th round), in 2004, 63 million individuals or 12 million \\nhouseholds fell into poverty due to health expenditures  (6.2% of all households).

The organised provision of such services may \\nconstitute a health care system.  \\nHealth is defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well being and just not the \\nnon existence of disease or ailment. Health is a primary human right and has been accorded due \\nimportance by the Constitution through Article 21.Though Article 21 stresses upon state governments \\nto safeguard the health and nutritional well being of the people, the central governme nt also plays an \\nactive role in the sector. Recognizing the critical role played by the Health Industry, the industry has \\nbeen conferred with the infrastructure status under section 10(23G) of the Income Act. \\nThe Indian Health sector consists of \\n• Medical care providers like physicians, specialist clinics, nursing homes, hospitals.  \\n• Diagnostic service centers and pathology laboratories.  \\n• Medical equipment manufacturers.  \\n• Contract research organizations (CRO's), pharmaceutical manufacturers  \\n                                                 \\n∗ Assistant Professor of Medical Surgical Nursing, Kozhys College of Nursing, Bangalore.

Since ancient times \\ntraditional practitioners of health care have cont ributed to the medicinal needs of society. Acute \\nknowledge in the medicinal properties of plants and herbs were passed on from one generation to \\nanother to be used for treatment. The colonial rule and the dominance of the British changed the \\nscenario. Hospitals managed by Christian missionaries took centre stage. Even the intellectual elite in \\nIndia with their pro west bias favored Western practices. \\nAfter Independence \\nPrior to independence the healthcare in India was in shambles with large number of deaths  and \\nspread of infectious diseases. After independence the Government of India laid stress on Primary \\nHealth Care and India has put in sustained efforts to better the health care system across the country. \\nThe government initiative was not enough to meet t he demands from a growing population be it in \\nprimary, secondary or tertiary health care. Alternate sources of finance were critical for the \\nsustainability of the health sector. \\nEntry of Private Sector \\nTill about 20 years back, the private sectors venture in the health care sector consisted of only \\nsolo practitioners, small hospitals and nursing homes. The quality of service provided was excellent \\nespecially in the hospitals run by charitable trusts and religious foundations. In 1980's realizing that the \\ngovernment on its own would not be able to provide health care, the government allowed the entry of \\nprivate sector to reduce the gap between supply and demand for healthcare. The private hospitals are \\nmanaged by corporate, non- profit or charitable organizations. The establishment of private sector has \\nresulted in the emergence of opportunities in terms of medical equipment, information technology in \\nhealth services, BPO, Telemedicine and medical tourism. \\nLarge companies and affluent individuals have started f ive star hospitals which dominate the \\nspace for high end market. The private sector has made tremendous progress, but on the flip side it is \\nalso responsible for increasing inequality in healthcare sector. The private should be more socially \\nrelevant and efforts must be made to make private sector accessible to the weaker section of society. \\nHealth care system in India \\nTraditional Healthcare Systems in India \\n‘SI_No__ Description Data\\n\\n1 Total Expenditure on Health as % of GDP (2003) 4.8%\\n2 Government Expenditure on Health as % of Total\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 24.8%\\n\\n3 Private Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure on Health (2003) 75.2%\\n4 Government Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure (2003) 3.9%\\n5 Extetnal Resources for Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure on Health (2003) 1.8%\\n6 Social Security Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nGeneral Government Expenditure on Health (2003) 4.2%\\n7 Out of Pocket Expenditure as % of Private\\n\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 97.0%\\n8 Private Prepaid Plans as % of Private\\n\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 0.9%\\n9 Per capita Total Expenditure on Health at\\n\\nAverage Exchange Rates (US $) ~ 2003 270\\n10 Per capita Government Expenditure on Health\\n\\non Average Exchange Rates (US §) - 2003 70\\n\\nSource: Working Together for Health, World Health Report, 2008; World\\nHealth Organisation, 2006\\n\\nGla 6xb OU PEgIIJ —*— pel csbyg 6xb\\n\\n408¥ 1082 10d€ 180\\\\ 1808 14898 S000 S001 SO0S S003 SOOT\\n4883-408t- 1882- 189E- 4 BB\\\\- 1898- 1833-S000- S004 -SO00S-S003-\\n\\nie) + + + + t + + + t t 0\\n2000 | | + 20\\n\\n40000 + + 400\\n42000 + 7 420\\n30000 + + S00\\n\\n32000 320\\n\\nDelsjs BM CSUs\", metadata={'source': 'data\\\\HealthCareSectorinindia-AnOverview.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Popular indigenous healthcare traditions \\ninclude Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, and Yoga.  \\nThe Ayurveda (meaning science of life) system deals with causes, symptoms, diagnoses, and \\ntreatment based on all aspects of well -being (mental, physical, and spiritual). These professionals, \\ntraditionally, have been inheriting the skills from their ancestors. However, with the advent of \\neducation, a variety of institutions offer training in indigenous medical practice. \\nThe Siddha system defines disease as the condition in which the normal equilibrium of the five \\nelements in human beings is lost resulting in different forms of discomfort. The diagnostic methods in \\nSiddha medical system are based more on  the clinical acumen of the physician after observation of the \\npatient, pulse and diagnosis and clinical history. \\nYoga is a science as well an art of healthy living physically, mentally, morally and spiritually. \\nYoga is believed to be founded by saints and sages of India several thousand years ago. Yoga has its \\norigin in the Vedas, and its philosophy is an art and science of living in tune with the universe. Yogis \\ngave rational interpretation of their experiences about Yoga and brought a practically sound a nd \\nscientifically prepared method within every one’s reach. \\nNaturopathy has several references in the Vedas and other ancient texts, which indicate that \\nthese methods were widely practised in ancient India. Naturopathy believes that all the diseases arise \\ndue to accumulation of morbid matter in the body and if scope is given for its removal, it provides cure \\nor relief. It also believes that the human body possesses inherent self -constructingand self -healing \\npowers. Naturopathy differs slightly with other sy stems of medicine, as it does not believe in the \\nspecific cause of disease and its specific treatment but takes into account the totality of factors \\nresponsible for diseases such as one’s un -natural habits in living, thinking, working, sleeping, or \\nrelaxation, and the environmental factors that disturbs the normal functioning of the body. \\nUnani system of medicine believes that the body is made up of four basic elements viz., earth, \\nair, water and fire, which have different temperaments i.e. cold, hot, wet a nd dry. After mixing and \\ninteraction of four elements a new compound having new temperament comes into existence i.e. hot -\\nwet, hot -dry, cold- wet and cold- dry. The body has simple and compound organs, which got their \\nnourishment through four humours, viz. blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile. Unani system of \\nmedicine believes in promotion of health, prevention of diseases and cure.  \\nIn addition to such healthcare systems, there are also faith / spiritual healers, who are largely \\npresent in rural parts of I ndia. Some spiritual leaders use one or more of the traditional therapies, viz, \\nAyurveda, Yoga or Naturopathy as one of the healing modes to cure their clients. \\n‘SI_No__ Description Data\\n\\n1 Total Expenditure on Health as % of GDP (2003) 4.8%\\n2 Government Expenditure on Health as % of Total\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 24.8%\\n\\n3 Private Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure on Health (2003) 75.2%\\n4 Government Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure (2003) 3.9%\\n5 Extetnal Resources for Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure on Health (2003) 1.8%\\n6 Social Security Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nGeneral Government Expenditure on Health (2003) 4.2%\\n7 Out of Pocket Expenditure as % of Private\\n\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 97.0%\\n8 Private Prepaid Plans as % of Private\\n\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 0.9%\\n9 Per capita Total Expenditure on Health at\\n\\nAverage Exchange Rates (US $) ~ 2003 270\\n10 Per capita Government Expenditure on Health\\n\\non Average Exchange Rates (US §) - 2003 70\\n\\nSource: Working Together for Health, World Health Report, 2008; World\\nHealth Organisation, 2006\\n\\nGla 6xb OU PEgIIJ —*— pel csbyg 6xb\\n\\n408¥ 1082 10d€ 180\\\\ 1808 14898 S000 S001 SO0S S003 SOOT\\n4883-408t- 1882- 189E- 4 BB\\\\- 1898- 1833-S000- S004 -SO00S-S003-\\n\\nie) + + + + t + + + t t 0\\n2000 | | + 20\\n\\n40000 + + 400\\n42000 + 7 420\\n30000 + + S00\\n\\n32000 320\\n\\nDelsjs BM CSUs', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\HealthCareSectorinindia-AnOverview.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The size, scale, and spread of the country hampered \\ncomplete adherence to the number of well -intended guidelines and regulations. Although there are \\nnorms and g uidelines, compliance is minimal. In reality, the sector operates in a largely unregulated \\nenvironment, with minimal controls on what services can be provided, by whom, in what manner, and \\nat what cost. Thus, wide disparities occur in access, cost, levels,  and quality of health services provided \\nacross the country. \\n India’s health system can be categorized into three distinct phases: \\na) In the initial phase of 1947- 1983, health policy was assumed to be based on two broad principles: \\n(i) that none should be denied healthcare for want of ability to pay, and (ii) that it was the responsibility \\nof the state to provide healthcare to the people.This phase saw moderate achievements. \\nb) In the second phase of 1983 -2000, a National Health Policy was announced for the  first time in \\n1983, which articulated the need to encourage private initiative in healthcare service delivery and \\nencouraged the private sector to invest in healthcare infrastructure through subsidies. The policy also \\nenhanced the access to publicly funde d primary healthcare, facilitating expansion of health facilities in \\nrural areas through National Health Programmes (NHPs). \\nc) The third phase, post-2000, is witnessing a further shift and broadening of focus; the current phase \\naddresses key issues such as public-private partnership, liberalization of insurance sector, and the \\ngovernment as a financier. \\nRole of Public Sector in Health Care \\n The public healthcare system consists of facilities run by the central and state government.  \\nThese public facilities provide  free or subsidized rates to lower income families in rural and urban \\nareas.The Constitution of India divides health- related responsibilities between the central and the state \\ngovernments. While the national government maintains responsibility for m edical research  and \\ntechnical education, state governments shoulder the responsibility for infrastructure, employment, and \\nservice delivery. The concurrent list (in the 9th schedule to the Constitution of India) includes issues \\nthat concern more than one state, e.g., preventing extension of infectious or contagious diseases among \\nstates. While the states have significant autonomy in managing their health systems, the national \\ngovernment exercises significant fiscal control over the states’ health systems. \\n \\n \\n‘SI_No__ Description Data\\n\\n1 Total Expenditure on Health as % of GDP (2003) 4.8%\\n2 Government Expenditure on Health as % of Total\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 24.8%\\n\\n3 Private Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure on Health (2003) 75.2%\\n4 Government Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure (2003) 3.9%\\n5 Extetnal Resources for Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure on Health (2003) 1.8%\\n6 Social Security Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nGeneral Government Expenditure on Health (2003) 4.2%\\n7 Out of Pocket Expenditure as % of Private\\n\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 97.0%\\n8 Private Prepaid Plans as % of Private\\n\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 0.9%\\n9 Per capita Total Expenditure on Health at\\n\\nAverage Exchange Rates (US $) ~ 2003 270\\n10 Per capita Government Expenditure on Health\\n\\non Average Exchange Rates (US §) - 2003 70\\n\\nSource: Working Together for Health, World Health Report, 2008; World\\nHealth Organisation, 2006\\n\\nGla 6xb OU PEgIIJ —*— pel csbyg 6xb\\n\\n408¥ 1082 10d€ 180\\\\ 1808 14898 S000 S001 SO0S S003 SOOT\\n4883-408t- 1882- 189E- 4 BB\\\\- 1898- 1833-S000- S004 -SO00S-S003-\\n\\nie) + + + + t + + + t t 0\\n2000 | | + 20\\n\\n40000 + + 400\\n42000 + 7 420\\n30000 + + S00\\n\\n32000 320\\n\\nDelsjs BM CSUs', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\HealthCareSectorinindia-AnOverview.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

On the one hand, low awareness and lack of understanding of product \\nfeatures, in addition to perceived apprehension in claims procedures and settlement, intimidates \\nconsumers from buying a health cover.  \\nKey Challenges \\n Despite these gains, a high proportion of the population continues to suffer and die from easily \\npreventable diseases, lack of access to affordable and quality care, and malnutrition.  Women and \\nchildren from low-income households are the most vulnerable. Problem areas include: \\nMaternal and child health: Only about half of pregnant women receive adequate antenatal coverage -  \\nat least three visits during one pregnancy. This percentage remains low and stagnant. While the \\npercentage of children between 12 -23 months of age that are fully immunized rose from 46% in 2004 \\nto 54% in 2008, these levels remain unacceptably low. Infant and maternal mortality rates are \\ndecreasing, but slowly. At the current rate of progress, India will not be able to achieve the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals for health. \\nChildhood nutrition: Despite the largest child -nutrition program in the world, rates of childhood \\nmalnutrition have remained unchanged for nearly two decades: 48% of children under the age of five \\nare stunted (low height for age), 43% are underweight (low weight for age), and 20% are wasted (low \\nweight for height). \\nNew diseases on the rise: At the same time, new health challenges are emerging. The rise in chronic \\nadult diseases and injuries is stretching the system’s capacity  to respond.  Non-communicable diseases \\nand injuries already account for about 60% of India’s disease burden, led by cardiovascular disease, \\nmental health, injuries, cancer, and diabetes.  \\nUnfinished agenda of communicable diseases : Although the prevalence  of HIV has recently been \\nlowered to an estimated 0.41% of the adult population, or approximately 2.5 million individuals, this \\nstill poses a very significant burden and requires continued efforts to avoid a devastating, more \\ngeneralized epidemic. Tuberculosis, malaria, polio, and dengue fever  still remain serious threats in a \\nnumber of states. \\nFinancial burden:  At over 70% of all health spending, out -of-pocket expenditures are by far the main \\nfinancing mechanism for health care in India. This poses considerable financial burden on households.  \\nBased on the National Sample Survey (60th round), in 2004, 63 million individuals or 12 million \\nhouseholds fell into poverty due to health expenditures  (6.2% of all households). The majority o f these \\nhouseholds (79%) became impoverished due to spending on outpatient care, including drugs, and the \\nremainder (21%) fell into poverty due to hospital care. \\n‘SI_No__ Description Data\\n\\n1 Total Expenditure on Health as % of GDP (2003) 4.8%\\n2 Government Expenditure on Health as % of Total\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 24.8%\\n\\n3 Private Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure on Health (2003) 75.2%\\n4 Government Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure (2003) 3.9%\\n5 Extetnal Resources for Health as % of\\n\\nTotal Expenditure on Health (2003) 1.8%\\n6 Social Security Expenditure on Health as % of\\n\\nGeneral Government Expenditure on Health (2003) 4.2%\\n7 Out of Pocket Expenditure as % of Private\\n\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 97.0%\\n8 Private Prepaid Plans as % of Private\\n\\nExpenditure on Health (2003) 0.9%\\n9 Per capita Total Expenditure on Health at\\n\\nAverage Exchange Rates (US $) ~ 2003 270\\n10 Per capita Government Expenditure on Health\\n\\non Average Exchange Rates (US §) - 2003 70\\n\\nSource: Working Together for Health, World Health Report, 2008; World\\nHealth Organisation, 2006\\n\\nGla 6xb OU PEgIIJ —*— pel csbyg 6xb\\n\\n408¥ 1082 10d€ 180\\\\ 1808 14898 S000 S001 SO0S S003 SOOT\\n4883-408t- 1882- 189E- 4 BB\\\\- 1898- 1833-S000- S004 -SO00S-S003-\\n\\nie) + + + + t + + + t t 0\\n2000 | | + 20\\n\\n40000 + + 400\\n42000 + 7 420\\n30000 + + S00\\n\\n32000 320\\n\\nDelsjs BM CSUs', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\HealthCareSectorinindia-AnOverview.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

Currently, India has approximately 860 beds per million population. It is \\nestimated that 450,000 additional hospital beds will be required by 2014. The government  is expected \\nto contribute only 15-20 per cent of the total, providing an enormous opportunity for private players to \\nfill the gap. \\n There is a strong demand for tertiary care hospitals, which emphasise on the treatment of \\nlifestyle diseases, focusing on s pecialities such as neurology, cardiology, oncology and orthopaedics. \\nTertiary hospitals are projected to grow faster than the overall healthcare sector, in response to the \\ngrowing incidence of lifestyle disease and the accelerating growth of medical tourism. \\nShortage of trained medical personnel :  India faces a huge shortage of trained medical personnel, \\nincluding doctors, nurses and especially paramedics, who may be more willing than doctors to live in \\nrural areas where access to care is limited.

However, only half of these visits are to doctors trained and licensed in modern \\nmedicine. Many private facilities remain unlicensed or are rarely inspected.

Since ancient times \\ntraditional practitioners of health care have contributed to the medicinal needs of society. Acute \\nknowledge in the medicinal properties of plants and herbs were passed on from one generation to \\nanother to be used for treatment. The colonial rule and the dominance of the British changed the \\nscenario. Hospitals managed by Christian missionaries took centre stage.

After independence the Government of India laid stress on Primary \\nHealth Care and India has put in sustained efforts to better the health care system across the country. \\nThe government initiative was not enough to meet the demands from a growing population be it in \\nprimary, secondary or tertiary health care. Alternate sources of finance were critical for the \\nsustainability of the health sector. \\nEntry of Private Sector \\nTill about 20 years back, the private sectors venture in the health care sector consisted of only \\nsolo practitioners, small hospitals and nursing homes. The quality of service provided was excellent \\nespecially in the hospitals run by charitable trusts and religious foundations. In 1980's realizing that the \\ngovernment on its own would not be able to provide health care, the government allowed the entry of \\nprivate sector to reduce the gap between supply and demand for healthcare.

The establishment of private sector has \\nresulted in the emergence of opportunities in terms of medical equipment, information technology in \\nhealth services, BPO, Telemedicine and medical tourism. \\nLarge companies and affluent individuals have started five star hospitals which dominate the \\nspace for high end market.

       " Document(page_content=' \\nIn India, in addition to existence of modern medicine, indigenous or traditional medical \\npractitioners continue to practice throughout the country. Popular indigenous healthcare traditions \\ninclude Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, and Yoga.  \\nThe Ayurveda (meaning science of life) system deals with causes, symptoms, diagnoses, and \\ntreatment based on all aspects of well-being (mental, physical, and spiritual). These professionals, \\ntraditionally, have been inheriting the skills from their ancestors. However, with the advent of \\neducation, a variety of institutions offer training in indigenous medical practice. \\nThe Siddha system defines disease as the condition in which the normal equilibrium of the five \\nelements in human beings is lost resulting in different forms of discomfort. The diagnostic methods in \\nSiddha medical system are based more on the clinical acumen of the physician after observation of the \\npatient, pulse and diagnosis and clinical history. \\nYoga is a science as well an art of healthy living physically, mentally, morally and spiritually. \\nYoga is believed to be founded by saints and sages of India several thousand years ago. Yoga has its \\norigin in the Vedas, and its philosophy is an art and science of living in tune with the universe. Yogis \\ngave rational interpretation of their experiences about Yoga and brought a practically sound and \\nscientifically prepared method within every one’s reach. \\nNaturopathy has several references in the Vedas and other ancient texts, which indicate that \\nthese methods were widely practised in ancient India. Naturopathy believes that all the diseases arise \\ndue to accumulation of morbid matter in the body and if scope is given for its removal, it provides cure \\nor relief. It also believes that the human body possesses inherent self-constructingand self-healing \\npowers. Naturopathy differs slightly with other systems of medicine, as it does not believe in the \\nspecific cause of disease and its specific treatment but takes into account the totality of factors \\nresponsible for diseases such as one’s un-natural habits in living, thinking, working, sleeping, or \\nrelaxation, and the environmental factors that disturbs the normal functioning of the body. \\nUnani system of medicine believes that the body is made up of four basic elements viz., earth, \\nair, water and fire, which have different temperaments i.e. cold, hot, wet and dry. After mixing and \\ninteraction of four elements a new compound having new temperament comes into existence i.e. hot-\\nwet, hot-dry, cold-wet and cold-dry.

       " Document(page_content='Modern (Allopathic) Healthcare Systems in India \\n \\nThe modern (allopathic) health care system in India consists of a public sector, a private sector, \\nand an informal network of care providers. The size, scale, and spread of the country hampered \\ncomplete adherence to the number of well-intended guidelines and regulations. Although there are \\nnorms and guidelines, compliance is minimal. In reality, the sector operates in a largely unregulated \\nenvironment, with minimal controls on what services can be provided, by whom, in what manner, and \\nat what cost. Thus, wide disparities occur in access, cost, levels, and quality of health services provided \\nacross the country. \\n \\nIndia’s health system can be categorized into three distinct phases: \\na) In the initial phase of 1947-1983, health policy was assumed to be based on two broad principles: \\n(i) that none should be denied healthcare for want of ability to pay, and (ii) that it was the responsibility \\nof the state to provide healthcare to the people.This phase saw moderate achievements. \\nb) In the second phase of 1983-2000, a National Health Policy was announced for the first time in \\n1983, which articulated the need to encourage private initiative in healthcare service delivery and \\nencouraged the private sector to invest in healthcare infrastructure through subsidies. The policy also \\nenhanced the access to publicly funded primary healthcare, facilitating expansion of health facilities in \\nrural areas through National Health Programmes (NHPs). \\nc) The third phase, post-2000, is witnessing a further shift and broadening of focus; the current phase \\naddresses key issues such as public-private partnership, liberalization of insurance sector, and the \\ngovernment as a financier. \\nRole of Public Sector in Health Care \\n \\nThe public healthcare system consists of facilities run by the central and state government.  \\nThese public facilities provide free or subsidized rates to lower income families in rural and urban \\nareas.The Constitution of India divides health-related responsibilities between the central and the state \\ngovernments. While the national government maintains responsibility for medical research and \\ntechnical education, state governments shoulder the responsibility for infrastructure, employment, and \\nservice delivery. The concurrent list (in the 9th schedule to the Constitution of India) includes issues \\nthat concern more than one state, e.g., preventing extension of infectious or contagious diseases among \\nstates. While the states have significant autonomy in managing their health systems, the national \\ngovernment exercises significant fiscal control over the states’ health systems. \\n \\n \\n', metadata={'source': 'data/HealthCareSectorinindia-AnOverview.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/HealthCareSectorinindia-AnOverview.pdf', 'page': 3, 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Admin', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 10.1 for Word', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20200322003644+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20200322003654+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

On the one hand, low awareness and lack of understanding of product \\nfeatures, in addition to perceived apprehension in claims procedures and settlement, intimidates \\nconsumers from buying a health cover.  \\nKey Challenges \\n \\nDespite these gains, a high proportion of the population continues to suffer and die from easily \\npreventable diseases, lack of access to affordable and quality care, and malnutrition.  Women and \\nchildren from low-income households are the most vulnerable. Problem areas include: \\nMaternal and child health: Only about half of pregnant women receive adequate antenatal coverage - \\nat least three visits during one pregnancy. This percentage remains low and stagnant. While the \\npercentage of children between 12-23 months of age that are fully immunized rose from 46% in 2004 \\nto 54% in 2008, these levels remain unacceptably low. Infant and maternal mortality rates are \\ndecreasing, but slowly. At the current rate of progress, India will not be able to achieve the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals for health. \\nChildhood nutrition: Despite the largest child-nutrition program in the world, rates of childhood \\nmalnutrition have remained unchanged for nearly two decades: 48% of children under the age of five \\nare stunted (low height for age), 43% are underweight (low weight for age), and 20% are wasted (low \\nweight for height). \\nNew diseases on the rise: At the same time, new health challenges are emerging. The rise in chronic \\nadult diseases and injuries is stretching the system’s capacity to respond.  Non-communicable diseases \\nand injuries already account for about 60% of India’s disease burden, led by cardiovascular disease, \\nmental health, injuries, cancer, and diabetes.  \\nUnfinished agenda of communicable diseases: Although the prevalence of HIV has recently been \\nlowered to an estimated 0.41% of the adult population, or approximately 2.5 million individuals, this \\nstill poses a very significant burden and requires continued efforts to avoid a devastating, more \\ngeneralized epidemic. Tuberculosis, malaria, polio, and dengue fever still remain serious threats in a \\nnumber of states. \\nFinancial burden:  At over 70% of all health spending, out-of-pocket expenditures are by far the main \\nfinancing mechanism for health care in India. This poses considerable financial burden on households.  \\nBased on the National Sample Survey (60th round), in 2004, 63 million individuals or 12 million \\nhouseholds fell into poverty due to health expenditures (6.2% of all households). The majority of these \\nhouseholds (79%) became impoverished due to spending on outpatient care, including drugs, and the \\nremainder (21%) fell into poverty due to hospital care. \\n', metadata={'source': 'data/HealthCareSectorinindia-AnOverview.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/HealthCareSectorinindia-AnOverview.pdf', 'page': 15, 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': 'Admin', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 10.1 for Word', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20200322003644+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20200322003654+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

Currently, India has approximately 860 beds per million population. It is \\nestimated that 450,000 additional hospital beds will be required by 2014. The government is expected \\nto contribute only 15-20 per cent of the total, providing an enormous opportunity for private players to \\nfill the gap. \\n \\nThere is a strong demand for tertiary care hospitals, which emphasise on the treatment of \\nlifestyle diseases, focusing on specialities such as neurology, cardiology, oncology and orthopaedics. \\nTertiary hospitals are projected to grow faster than the overall healthcare sector, in response to the \\ngrowing incidence of lifestyle disease and the accelerating growth of medical tourism. \\nShortage of trained medical personnel : India faces a huge shortage of trained medical personnel, \\nincluding doctors, nurses and especially paramedics, who may be more willing than doctors to live in \\nrural areas where access to care is limited. There is an immediate need for medical education and \\ntraining, which could provide additional opportunities for private sector providers or public-private-\\npartnerships (PPP). \\nSystemic Constraints \\n \\nDespite the Central Government’s focus on health issues, a major challenge is to carry the \\nmomentum to the states. Increased funding will need to translate into greater access to health care and \\nmore effective delivery of health services. The following systemic constraints will need to be overcome \\nto achieve the MDGs for health: \\nLow Effectiveness of Public Health Spending due to: (i) general absence of accountability \\narrangements and incentives for performance; (ii) ineffective targeting and inadequate emphasis on \\ncore public health functions; (iii) very weak information environment, including deficient monitoring \\nand near absence of impact evaluations; (iv) insufficient engagement with non-government sector and \\nabsence of a “whole system” perspective; (v) inadequate human resources in both numbers and quality; \\n(vi) insufficient capacity in the states,(vii) little attention to or assessment of quality of care; and (vi) \\nvariable political priority for health across states. \\nUnregulated Private Provision of Health Care: 80% of Indians seek private provision when faced \\nwith an illness.  However, only half of these visits are to doctors trained and licensed in modern \\nmedicine. Many private facilities remain unlicensed or are rarely inspected. The private medical market \\nis unregulated with little concern for effectiveness, quality, costs and consumer safety. Accreditation is \\nstill in its infancy.

Nearly all private health service providers require families to spend out-\\nof-pocket at the point of service. This leaves people, especially the poor, highly vulnerable. There is \\nstill a long way to go before a sizeable proportion of the Indian population has adequate financial \\nprotection against health related events. \\nLittle Emphasis on Communication to Improve Health and Create Demand for Health Services: \\nIndia’s health system is unprepared to deal with non-communicable diseases. To address them, much \\nmore effort is required to expand health promotion and prevention. Addressing malnutrition involves \\nrefocusing efforts on behavior change around key issues such as feeding practices for infants and young \\nchildren. \\nConclusion \\n \\nIndia’s health scenario currently presents a contrasting picture. While health tourism and private \\nhealthcare are being promoted, a large section of Indian population still reels under the risk of curable \\ndiseases that do not receive adequate attention of policymakers. India’s National Rural Health Mission \\nis undeniably an intervention that has put public heath care upfront. Although the government has been \\nmaking efforts to increase healthcare spending via initiatives like the National Rural Health Mission, \\nmuch still remains to be done.

After independence the Government of India laid stress on Primary \\nHealth Care and India has put in sustained efforts to better the health care system across the country. \\nThe government initiative was not enough to meet t he demands from a growing population be it in \\nprimary, secondary or tertiary health care. Alternate sources of finance were critical for the \\nsustainability of the health sector. \\nEntry of Private Sector \\nTill about 20 years back, the private sectors venture in the health care sector consisted of only \\nsolo practitioners, small hospitals and nursing homes. The quality of service provided was excellent \\nespecially in the hospitals run by charitable trusts and religious foundations. In 1980's realizing that the \\ngovernment on its own would not be able to provide health care, the government allowed the entry of \\nprivate sector to reduce the gap between supply and demand for healthcare. The private hospitals are \\nmanaged by corporate, non- profit or charitable organizations. The establishment of private sector has \\nresulted in the emergence of opportunities in terms of medical equipment, information technology in \\nhealth services, BPO, Telemedicine and medical tourism. \\nLarge companies and affluent individuals have started f ive star hospitals which dominate the \\nspace for high end market. The private sector has made tremendous progress, but on the flip side it is \\nalso responsible for increasing inequality in healthcare sector.

       " Document(page_content=' In India, in addition to existence of modern medicine, indigenous or traditional medical \\npractitioners continue to practice throughout the country. Popular indigenous healthcare traditions \\ninclude Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, and Yoga.  \\nThe Ayurveda (meaning science of life) system deals with causes, symptoms, diagnoses, and \\ntreatment based on all aspects of well -being (mental, physical, and spiritual). These professionals, \\ntraditionally, have been inheriting the skills from their ancestors. However, with the advent of \\neducation, a variety of institutions offer training in indigenous medical practice. \\nThe Siddha system defines disease as the condition in which the normal equilibrium of the five \\nelements in human beings is lost resulting in different forms of discomfort. The diagnostic methods in \\nSiddha medical system are based more on  the clinical acumen of the physician after observation of the \\npatient, pulse and diagnosis and clinical history. \\nYoga is a science as well an art of healthy living physically, mentally, morally and spiritually. \\nYoga is believed to be founded by saints and sages of India several thousand years ago. Yoga has its \\norigin in the Vedas, and its philosophy is an art and science of living in tune with the universe. Yogis \\ngave rational interpretation of their experiences about Yoga and brought a practically sound a nd \\nscientifically prepared method within every one’s reach. \\nNaturopathy has several references in the Vedas and other ancient texts, which indicate that \\nthese methods were widely practised in ancient India. Naturopathy believes that all the diseases arise \\ndue to accumulation of morbid matter in the body and if scope is given for its removal, it provides cure \\nor relief. It also believes that the human body possesses inherent self -constructingand self -healing \\npowers. Naturopathy differs slightly with other sy stems of medicine, as it does not believe in the \\nspecific cause of disease and its specific treatment but takes into account the totality of factors \\nresponsible for diseases such as one’s un -natural habits in living, thinking, working, sleeping, or \\nrelaxation, and the environmental factors that disturbs the normal functioning of the body. \\nUnani system of medicine believes that the body is made up of four basic elements viz., earth, \\nair, water and fire, which have different temperaments i.e. cold, hot, wet a nd dry. After mixing and \\ninteraction of four elements a new compound having new temperament comes into existence i.e. hot -\\nwet, hot -dry, cold- wet and cold- dry. The body has simple and compound organs, which got their \\nnourishment through four humours, viz. blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile. Unani system of \\nmedicine believes in promotion of health, prevention of diseases and cure.  \\nIn addition to such healthcare systems, there are also faith / spiritual healers, who are largely \\npresent in rural parts of I ndia. Some spiritual leaders use one or more of the traditional therapies, viz, \\nAyurveda, Yoga or Naturopathy as one of the healing modes to cure their clients.

The policy also \\nenhanced the access to publicly funde d primary healthcare, facilitating expansion of health facilities in \\nrural areas through National Health Programmes (NHPs). \\nc) The third phase, post-2000, is witnessing a further shift and broadening of focus; the current phase \\naddresses key issues such as public-private partnership, liberalization of insurance sector, and the \\ngovernment as a financier. \\nRole of Public Sector in Health Care \\n The public healthcare system consists of facilities run by the central and state government.  \\nThese public facilities provide  free or subsidized rates to lower income families in rural and urban \\nareas.The Constitution of India divides health- related responsibilities between the central and the state \\ngovernments.

Medical tourism \\nis expected to generate revenue around US$ 3 billion by 2013, growing at a CAGR of around 26 per \\ncent during 2011–2013. The number of medical tourists is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of over 19 \\nper cent during the forecast p eriod to reach 1.3 million by 2013. Going by the current pace with which \\nthis segment has been growing, the revenues from this segment could touch US$ 2.2 billion by 2012. \\nThe Government has also been proactive in encouraging prospects in this sector with a number of \\ninitiatives: A new category of visa “Medical Visa” (‘M’-Visa) has been introduced which can be given \\nfor a specific purpose to foreign tourists coming into India. \\n Domestic medical tourism in the country has also seen growth in the recent years . As per the \\nreport ‘Domestic Tourism in India, 2008-09’ released by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), \\ntrips for ‘health and medical’ purposes formed 7 per cent of overnight trips in the rural population and \\nabout 3.5 per cent in the urban populati on. ‘Health and medical’ purposes accounted for 17 per cent of \\nsame-day trips in rural India and 8 per cent in urban India. Expenditure on medical trips accounted for \\n30 per cent of all overnight trip expenditure for rural India and 15 per cent for urban. \\nHealth Insurance \\n The growing affluence of the Indian middle -class accompanied with lifestyle- related diseases \\nand inflationary healthcare costs are driving the demand for health insurance in India today. Launch of \\nnew hospital chains with a stress on holi stic well-being is further accentuating this demand, especially \\nin urban areas. Meanwhile the government, in collaboration with non governmental organisations and \\ninsurers, is launching various schemes to provide low cost health insurance facility to all c itizens. All \\nfactors combined contributed to the nearly 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in premiums of \\nhealth insurance since the sector’s liberalisation a decade ago.  \\n The Indian health insurance market has emerged as a new and lucrative growth av enue for both \\nthe existing players as well as the new entrants. The health insurance market represents one the fastest \\ngrowing and second largest non- life insurance segment in the country. The Indian health insurance \\nmarket has posted record growth in the last two fiscals (2008 -09 and 2009- 10). Moreover, as per the \\nreport, the health insurance premium is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 25 per cent for the period \\nspanning from 2009- 10 to 2013- 14. However, certain intrinsic factors inhibit this segment fro m \", metadata={'source': 'data/HealthCareSectorinindia-AnOverview.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

On the one hand, low awareness and lack of understanding of product \\nfeatures, in addition to perceived apprehension in claims procedures and settlement, intimidates \\nconsumers from buying a health cover.  \\nKey Challenges \\n Despite these gains, a high proportion of the population continues to suffer and die from easily \\npreventable diseases, lack of access to affordable and quality care, and malnutrition.  Women and \\nchildren from low-income households are the most vulnerable. Problem areas include: \\nMaternal and child health: Only about half of pregnant women receive adequate antenatal coverage -  \\nat least three visits during one pregnancy. This percentage remains low and stagnant. While the \\npercentage of children between 12 -23 months of age that are fully immunized rose from 46% in 2004 \\nto 54% in 2008, these levels remain unacceptably low. Infant and maternal mortality rates are \\ndecreasing, but slowly. At the current rate of progress, India will not be able to achieve the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals for health. \\nChildhood nutrition: Despite the largest child -nutrition program in the world, rates of childhood \\nmalnutrition have remained unchanged for nearly two decades: 48% of children under the age of five \\nare stunted (low height for age), 43% are underweight (low weight for age), and 20% are wasted (low \\nweight for height). \\nNew diseases on the rise: At the same time, new health challenges are emerging. The rise in chronic \\nadult diseases and injuries is stretching the system’s capacity  to respond.  Non-communicable diseases \\nand injuries already account for about 60% of India’s disease burden, led by cardiovascular disease, \\nmental health, injuries, cancer, and diabetes.  \\nUnfinished agenda of communicable diseases : Although the prevalence  of HIV has recently been \\nlowered to an estimated 0.41% of the adult population, or approximately 2.5 million individuals, this \\nstill poses a very significant burden and requires continued efforts to avoid a devastating, more \\ngeneralized epidemic. Tuberculosis, malaria, polio, and dengue fever  still remain serious threats in a \\nnumber of states. \\nFinancial burden:  At over 70% of all health spending, out -of-pocket expenditures are by far the main \\nfinancing mechanism for health care in India. This poses considerable financial burden on households.  \\nBased on the National Sample Survey (60th round), in 2004, 63 million individuals or 12 million \\nhouseholds fell into poverty due to health expenditures  (6.2% of all households). The majority o f these \\nhouseholds (79%) became impoverished due to spending on outpatient care, including drugs, and the \\nremainder (21%) fell into poverty due to hospital care.

       " Document(page_content=' In order to meet manpower shortages and reach world standards, India would require \\ninvestments of up to $20 billion over the next five years. 40 per cent of the primary health centres in \\nIndia are understaffed. Currently, India has approximately 860 beds per million population. It is \\nestimated that 450,000 additional hospital beds will be required by 2014. The government  is expected \\nto contribute only 15-20 per cent of the total, providing an enormous opportunity for private players to \\nfill the gap. \\n There is a strong demand for tertiary care hospitals, which emphasise on the treatment of \\nlifestyle diseases, focusing on s pecialities such as neurology, cardiology, oncology and orthopaedics. \\nTertiary hospitals are projected to grow faster than the overall healthcare sector, in response to the \\ngrowing incidence of lifestyle disease and the accelerating growth of medical tourism. \\nShortage of trained medical personnel :  India faces a huge shortage of trained medical personnel, \\nincluding doctors, nurses and especially paramedics, who may be more willing than doctors to live in \\nrural areas where access to care is limited. There is  an immediate need for medical education and \\ntraining, which could provide additional opportunities for private sector providers or public -private-\\npartnerships (PPP). \\nSystemic Constraints \\n Despite the Central Government’s focus on health issues, a major ch allenge is to carry the \\nmomentum to the states. Increased funding will need to translate into greater access to health care and \\nmore effective delivery of health services. The following systemic constraints will need to be overcome \\nto achieve the MDGs for health: \\nLow Effectiveness of Public Health Spending  due to: (i) general absence of accountability \\narrangements and incentives for performance ; (ii) ineffective targeting  and inadequate emphasis on \\ncore public health functions; (iii) very weak information e nvironment, including deficient monitoring  \\nand near absence of impact evaluations ; (iv) insufficient engagement with non- government sector and \\nabsence of a “whole system” perspective; (v) inadequate human resources in both numbers and quality; \\n(vi) insufficient capacity in the states,(vii) little attention to or assessment of quality of care ; and (vi) \\nvariable political priority for health across states. \\nUnregulated Private Provision of Health Care : 80% of Indians seek private provision when faced \\nwith an i llness.  However, only half of these visits are to doctors trained and licensed in modern \\nmedicine. Many private facilities remain unlicensed or are rarely inspected. The private medical market \\nis unregulated with little concern for effectiveness, quality,  costs and consumer safety. Accreditation is \\nstill in its infancy. While the government recognizes the potential for public -private partnerships to \\nimprove basic health care, many ongoing initiatives appear ad hoc.

Nearly all private health s ervice providers require families to spend out -\\nof-pocket at the point of service. This leaves people, especially the poor, highly vulnerable. There is \\nstill a long way to go before a sizeable proportion of the Indian population has adequate financial \\nprotection against health related events. \\nLittle Emphasis on Communication  to Improve Health and Create Demand for Health Services : \\nIndia’s health system is unprepared to deal with non-communicable diseases. To address them, much \\nmore effort is required to expa nd health promotion and prevention. Addressing malnutrition  involves \\nrefocusing efforts on behavior change around key issues such as feeding practices for infants and young \\nchildren. \\nConclusion \\n India’s health scenario currently presents a contrasting picture. While health tourism and private \\nhealthcare are being promoted, a large section of Indian population still reels  under the risk of curable \\ndiseases that do not receive adequate attention of policymakers.  India’s National Rural Health Mission \\nis undeniably an intervention that has put public heath care upfront. Although the government has been \\nmaking efforts to increase healthcare spending via initiatives like the National Rural Health Mission, \\nmuch still remains to be done. The priority will be to deve lop effective and sustainable health systems \\nthat can meet the dual demands posed by the growth in non communicable diseases and peoples’ needs \\nfor better quality and higher levels of health care.  \\nReference \\nBhat  Ramesh (1999).
