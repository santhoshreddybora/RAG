The major components of the Indian healthcare sector include the public sector, private sector, and traditional healthcare providers. The public sector encompasses government-run facilities such as rural hospitals and community health centres (CHCs), which serve large populations, often with plans to upgrade facilities for better service delivery. The private sector is diverse, comprising hospitals, nursing homes, pharmaceutical firms, and individual practitioners, and accounts for a significant majority of human resources, advanced medical technology, and hospital beds in the country. Traditional healthcare providers, including practitioners of Ayurveda, Unani, and other indigenous systems, also form an integral part of the healthcare landscape. Additionally, the informal network of care providers contributes to the accessibility of medical services across different regions. Overall, the Indian healthcare system is characterized by its mixed structure, encompassing modern allopathic medicine, traditional practices, and a substantial private sector presence.
